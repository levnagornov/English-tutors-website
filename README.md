# English-tutors-flask-app

It's my second app on course by learning Flask. I make site of english language tutors.

Using dependencies: Flask + WTForms, Bootstrap 4. As a database I will use json file.

It should have:
* main page (main adv bar and 3 random tours)
* page of all tutors
* page of a certain tutor
* page of goals
* booking page and booking approved page
* page of request for help and request approved page
* admin's page with logging in for creating/editing/deleting tutors
